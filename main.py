#! Spider Plant
#* Water: This is going to be a test you should water your plant once a week with 100 millaletres.
#* Sun: Should be out of direct sun light.

#? Extra Information
#* Water your spider plant until the soil is thoroughly moist and some water runs out the bottom of the pot. That extra water will help leach salts from the soil and the root zone. Discard the extra water so it isn't reabsorbed.
#* Spider plants thrive in humid climates, so place a humidifier in the same room as your spider plant.

#! Jungle Plant
#TODO: Water: ??????? Spray Once a week with one spray of the bottle. I will spray once and time how long it take for it to need another water. 
#* Sun: right but indirect light

#? Extra Information
#* They like to be kept well watered, although this can be cut back a little in winter, and they thrive in high humidity, either grow it in a steamy room, mist it with water regularly, and/or sit the pot on a tray of dampened shingle.  
#* Calathea can be propagated by division at repotting time. Keep new divisions warm and moist by covering the pot with plastic and providing reduced light until active growth starts again. The plant should be repotted every year or every other year into fresh potting mix. Divide it at repotting time.
